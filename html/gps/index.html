<!-- The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags are tp give meaning to the tag, and make it more understandable to the browser and also the developer. Instead of using div tag it makes more sense to use section, article tags - easier to interpret. As I learn to create more complex webpages in the future, I can see sematic tags come in handy to make your code look seamless. Creating snippets was really cool. Saves time, and just really useful. Creating a snippet, first I was confused as to where to put the code, but after seeing examples, i got it. -->
