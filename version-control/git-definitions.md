# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is used so that we can make changes to files and have the entire history of changes. It's useful to keep track of the code when you're working with other people. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	Branching is useful so that we don't destroy the master file/folder. We use branch to work on a feauture and make changes, and discard when not necessary without hurting the master file.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	Commit is when you make changes and save it to your repo. A good commit message is when you explain your changes specifically.
* What is a merge conflict?
	Merge conflict happens when the file you're editing is deleted by someone else who had the same file repo. Or it happens when there's competing line changes.

	Just making some changes for teacher.
