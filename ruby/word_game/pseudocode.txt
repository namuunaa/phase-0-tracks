Game design pseudocode

-Create a class for word guessing game
  -Create a method that asks the user-1 to guess a word based on the length.
    -Until the user correctly guesses the word, ask them to guess the word.
    -Set a tracker for each time the user guesses, and warn the user how many guesses they have left
    -If the user repeats a guess, do not count in tracker
    -If the user reaches the limit, they lose.
    -Else If the user guesses a letter correct, change the current state of the word each time.
    -If the user guesses the word correct, show a congratulatory message
    -If the user didn't guess the word, show a taunting message.
-Create a new instance of word guessing game class
  -Ask user-2 to input a word to guess, and save the answer
  -Give user-1 a clue of how many letters the word consists, and ask them to guess the word.
  -If the user guesses the word correct, show a congratulatory message
  -If the user didn't guess the word, show a taunting message.
